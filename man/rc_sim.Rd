\description{
This function calculates the change in carbon stock or C pools (in kg C per ha) based on organic matter amendments, crop rotation, and long-term averaged weather conditions.
}
\details{
This function simulates the fate of SOC given the impact of soil properties, weather and management.
The soil_properties table is required. 
When no weather inputs are given, these are estimated from long-term average weather conditions in the Netherlands.

soil_properties: soil properties table

* A_C_OF (numeric), soil organic carbon content (g C/kg), preferably for soil depth 0.3 m
* B_C_ST03 (numeric), soil organic carbon stock (Mg C/ha), preferably for soil depth 0.3 m. Required if A_C_OF is not supplied
* A_CLAY_MI (numeric), clay fraction (\%)
* A_DENSITY_SA (numeric), dry soil bulk density(g/cm3). In case this is not know, can be calculated using function \link{rc_calculate_bd} given a clay and organic matter content
