\description{
This function calculates the change in carbon stock or C pools (in kg C per ha) based on organic matter amendments, crop rotation, and long-term averaged weather conditions.
}
\details{
This function simulates the fate of SOC given the impact of soil properties, weather and management.
The following inputs are mandatory: rothc_rotation, A_SOM_LOI (\%), and A_CLAY_MI (\%). All other data is optional.
When no weather inputs are given, these are estimated from long-term average weather conditions in the Netherlands.

soil_properties: soil properties table
Includes the columns:
* A_C_OF (numeric), soil organic carbon content (g C/kg), preferably for soil depth 0.3 m
* B_C_ST03 (numeric), soil organic carbon stock (Mg C/ha), preferably for soil depth 0.3 m. Required if A_C_OF is not supplied
* A_CLAY_MI (numeric), clay fraction (\%)
* A_DENSITY_SA (numeric), dry soil bulk density(g/cm3)

rothc_amendment: amendment table
Includes the columns:
* P_ID (character), ID of the soil amendment product
* P_NAME (character), name of the soil amendment product, optional
* P_C_OF_INPUT (numeric), the organic carbon input from soil amendment product on a field level (kg C/ha)
* P_DOSE (numeric), applied dose of soil amendment product (kg/ha), required if P_C_OF_INPUT is not supplied
* P_C_OF (numeric), organic carbon content of the soil amendment product (g C/kg), required if P_C_OF_INPUT is not supplied
* P_HC (numeric), the humification coefficient of the soil amendment product (fraction)
* year (date), year of fertilizer application
* month (numeric), month of fertilizer application, optional

rothc_rotation: crop table
Includes the columns: 
* year,
* B_LU (a crop id), 
* B_LU_NAME (a crop name, optional),
* B_LU_HC, the humification coefficient of crop organic matter (-). When not supplied, default RothC value will be used
* B_C_OF_INPUT, the organic carbon input on field level (kg C/ha)
May additionally include the columns M_GREEN_TIMING, M_CROPRESIDUE, M_IRRIGATION and M_RENEWAL, all in upper case.
* M_GREEN_TIMING (character) the month in which the catch crop is sown, options: (august,september,october,november,never)
* M_CROPRESIDUE (boolean) whether crop residues are amended to the soil after harvest.
* M_IRRIGATION (boolean) whether the crop is irrigated.
* M_RENEWAL (boolean) whether the grassland is renewed (only applicable for grassland)

rothc_parms: simulation parameters
Table with possible parameters to adapt the calculations. May include the columns initialize, c_fractions, dec_rates, simyears and unit.
* initialize: scenario to initialize the carbon pools. Options TRUE or FALSE, default is FALSE
* c_fractions: Distribution over the different C pools.
* dec_rates: Decomposition rates of the different pools
* simyears: Duration of simulation (years), default is 50
* unit: Unit in which the output should be given. Options: 'A_SOM_LOI' (\% organic matter),'psoc' (g C/kg), 'psomperfraction' (\% organic matter of each fraction), 'Cstock' (kg C/ha of each fraction)
