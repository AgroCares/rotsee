\details{
#' soil_properties: soil properties table
Includes the columns:
* A_C_OF (numeric), soil organic carbon content (g C/kg), preferably for soil depth 0.3 m
* B_C_ST03 (numeric), soil organic carbon stock (Mg C/ha), preferably for soil depth 0.3 m. Required if A_C_OF is not supplied
* A_CLAY_MI (numeric), clay fraction (\%)
* A_DENSITY_SA (numeric), dry soil bulk density(g/cm3). In case this is not know, can be calculated using function \link{rc_calculate_bd} given a clay and organic matter content

amendment: amendment table. Input can be duplicated to cover the entire simulation period using \link{rc_extend_amendments}
Includes the columns:
* B_C_OF_INPUT (numeric), the organic carbon input from soil amendment product on a field level (kg C/ha)
* P_DOSE (numeric), applied dose of soil amendment product (kg/ha), required if B_C_OF_INPUT is not supplied
* P_C_OF (numeric), organic carbon content of the soil amendment product (g C/kg), required if B_C_OF_INPUT is not supplied
* P_HC (numeric), the humification coefficient of the soil amendment product (fraction)
* P_DATE_FERTILIZATION (date), date of fertilizer application (formatted YYYY-MM-DD)

crops: crop table. Input can be duplicated to cover the entire simulation period using \link{rc_extend_crops}
Includes the columns: 
* B_LU_START (start of crop rotation),
* B_LU_END (end of crop rotation),
* B_LU (a crop id), 
* B_LU_NAME (a crop name, optional),
* B_LU_HC, the humification coefficient of crop organic matter (-). When not supplied, default RothC value will be used
* B_C_OF_INPUT, the organic carbon input on field level (kg C/ha). In case not known, can be calculated using function \link{rc_calculate_B_C_OF}


rothc.parms: list with RothC parameters.
Contains the following columns:
* k1 (numeric) decomposition rate of the DPM pool
* k2 (numeric) decomposition rate of the RPM pool
* k3 (numeric) decomposition rate of the BIO pool
* k4 (numeric) decomposition rate of the hum pool
* abc (function) function to calculate rate modifying factors as function of time
* R1 (numeric) Correction factor for soil structure
* time (list) list of the entire simulation period

rothc.events: data table with C input events
Contains the following columns:
* time (numeric) time within the simulation run, where 1 equals the first year
* var (character) C pool under consideration, options being 'CDPM', 'CRPM', and 'CHUM'.
* method (character) Method of considering listed value, default is add.
* value (numeric) carbon amount added (kg C/ha)

dt.soc: data table with soil information
contains at least the following columns:
* A_CLAY_MI (numeric), clay content (\%)
* toc (numeric), total carbon content (kg C / ha)

weather: Weather table. If no table is given, average Dutch conditions are used
Includes the columns:
* month
* W_TEMP_MEAN_MONTH (temperature in Â°C)
* W_PREC_SUM_MONTH (precipitation in mm)
* W_ET_POT_MONTH (potential evapotranspiration in mm)
* W_ET_ACT_MONTH (actual evapotranspiration in mm)

Choice of initialisation type depends on data. spinup_simulation/spinup_analytical_bodemcoolstof assume equilibrium in C distribution between pools; 
spinup_analytical_Heuvelink assumes equilibrium in total C stocks. If C stocks are in equilibrium, the latter is preferable
Otherwise one of the other two is fine.
